# Great meetup!
R-Ladies Highland Park hosted our first meetup event at Pino's in Highland Park on Friday, June 14th at 7pm.  It was so great to have fun conversations with such a cool group of ladies.  It felt really good to meet other people who have had similar struggles and wins learning R. We decided to create a slack workspace ([sign up with an email request](<mailto:highlandpark@rladies.org>)) so that we could connect more easily and share info on specific topics, like data visualization, data cleaning, and learning R.
